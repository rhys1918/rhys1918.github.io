summary: "My robotics club developed a scouting app that helps us collect data on other team's robots through HTML and Javascript."
---

This project was done by a group during our junior and senior year of highschool. The goal of the scouting app was to collect data of other robots in the competition of to figure out how each robot would score in the game, strategy the team use with the robot, and how consistent the robot would score during the game. When users input the data they collect from the game, the app would calculate the average and mean of the robot. Which it would be uploaded to a table on the app to display the mean data of robot for the whole competition. When searching up the team on the app it would display their all of their from each match data and can be reorganized into a different table to get their mean and average of the compeition. This project was done through using Javascript and HTML coding on VsCode. Which include the app design, colors, back and front end of the app, and collecting data for calculating mean and average.
