The game prompt from the competition was to foucs on issues that happen often in Hawai'i. So my team and I made the decision to make game about invasive species attacking the coral reef on Maui, which we deicided to use tilapia as a our invasive species that are attacking the coral reef. The game itself is a horde shooter like game that takes in cards to stop the tilapia from crossing over to the otherside of the screen to reach the coral reef. The first iteration and second iteration of the games was made in scratch, but the first iteration used scratch's pre-made images as place holders of the cards, effects, sounds, and the fish. While the second iteration used original artwork for the cards, effects, sounds, and fish. The first iteration of the game was used to be submitted to the competition at the time, while the second iteration of the game expanded on top of the first game with additional powerups to the cards effect and adding a new time stop card. However, the second iteration of the game was used as way to create a game as hobby rather than making it for competition.

WHen going over the roles of the game, I was given the role as assistant programemr and beta tester for the game. In the first iteration of the game, my team and I had only five hours to work on it at night before to submit for judging and we decide to do a simple game to do within that time. When going through my role for the first verison of the games I helped my project manager with develop the code, give advice where he should code the game, and help with fixing any bugs that was made in the code. In the second iteration of the game, I was just a beta tester for the game that helped with spotting any bugs that needed to be address to the game creator so he can fix in his code, were he later reupload the new verison of the game.

Getting to help create these has let me learned that it really sucks to make a game work under five hours before competition and we needed more time to make it look nicer to present to the judges for the first verison of the game. Secondly I learned that during the second iteration of the game, it was fun to beta test for the game and to find bugs or glitches that needed to be fix and fixing these small errors will make the game run more smoother. Finally, I learned that in both games it is important to communicate with each of any errors or bugs to make the game run smoother and to have fun playing the game afterwords without any worries having issues with the game.
