The goal of the robot was to handle a set of objectives with another robot from a different team in the game that overcomed what team built, programmed, and document throughtout the season. The team was split into three departments that handle programming, buidling, and doucmenting the robot during the season. Getting to programming side of things, the robot was coded using a program called VEX Pro V5, which uses C++, Python, or block code to program the motors or brain of the robot. My team used C++ as our main way to code the robot, code was tasks to handle driver control input and autonomous control during the different portions of the game or when doing skills check of how our robot performed alone. Additionally, we either used GitHub or Google Drives to save changes done to the code. The builders on the other had built the robot with V5 motors, aluminum metal, and gears to make the robots move according to input from a controller or from a program. Lastly, the documenters handle all documentation required for the game, such as the binder for judges to see through, logs of what happened during the week, and taking pictures of process of the robot or take competition photos.

During this season, I was assigned as lead programmer and programming mentor for the group since I had experince in the competition coding program and was told to help teach new programmers how to code from scratch or to enchance their knowledge futher as a programmer. Being in this role I learned that I would communicate with other leads from different departments in the group to disscuss what to do tasks needed to be done for robot, what progress we have made during the week, and decide important dates to complete certain tasks by. Additionally, I learned that I mentoring new programmers have its pros and cons to them. For example, after I taught the new programmers how to code basic materials, I delegated them tasks for them to code for robot and would later review their code with them and merge their code to the main branch. The downside of it is when I get sick I would get calls from the new programmers that the code doesn't work during testing periods, which I have to try and describe to the new programmers how fix the issue through text messages or calls on the phone while being sick. But in any case, I think this experince to be worth it, since I understand what tasks I needed to do as lead programmer and the thrill of competition is fun to experince.
