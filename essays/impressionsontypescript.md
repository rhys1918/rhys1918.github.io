## Discovering & Learning TypeScript  

Before coming into this module, I already had experience with C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and HTML since highschool. Getting to work with TypeSrcipt felt more like a new perspective than starting scratch. What stoof out to me when learning about TypeScript was how it blened the flexibility of JavaScript with the structure I was used to in strongly typed languages like C++ and Java. The ability to define types made coding feel more predicatable and reliable, while still keeping the dynamic and creative aspects that I liked Java and JavaScript. This language type has given me best of both worlds. 

Although I had used features like `let`, `const`, `var`, arrow functions, static typing, and template literals in other programs, this module gave me a deeper understand how they fit in with TypeScript. When writing code through TypeScript, catching errors m . It reminded me of the structure of Java and C++, but with a syntax that was lighter and easier to work with. I realized that TypeScript is not just about preventing errors, itâ€™s also about writing clean and maintainable code.  

## Athletic Software Engineering  

The athletic software engineering approach in this module reminded me a lot of my experince in robotics. During robotics competitions, there was constant pressure to solve problems quickly before a match starts, whether it meant fixing code, debugging erros, or making last-minute adjustments in the program. That same intensity came through in the WODs, where I had to think fast and code accurately under a strcit time limit. Just like in robotics, repetition and urgency to fix and develop code under a time limit pushed me to develop "muscle memory" in sovling and developing ideas to fix issues very quickly. Althrough the process was stressful, having a sense of experience from robotics has made me grow and understand how to maintain pressure and find solutions quickly when doing WODs in class.

## Final Thoughts  

When discussing about TypeScript as program langauge, I see it as a strong tool software engineering tool because it combines structere and flexibility. It adds reliablity while allowing creativity, and it feels easier to maintain when trying to fix errors. Although the athletic software engineering was challenging and stresful to do, the experince I had from robotics and working on practice WODs has helpe me code quickly and accrately as best as I can

This module showed me that TypeScript is an excellent tool for modern software engineering because it balances structure and flexibility in a way that fits well with my background in multiple languages. I can see it being especially useful in larger projects where clarity and maintainability matter. At the same time, the athletic software engineering approach gave me confidence that I can continue improving through disciplined practice. Moving forward, I want to use TypeScript not only as a programming language but also as a way to sharpen my skills as a software engineer.
