## The Dream

From a young age, I was fascinated by the idea of building and creating. As a child, I would play with Legos and build buildings or rooms from my imagination. With each block I snapped together, I saw that my imagination helped over saw my construction and design coming alive before me. I could start with nothing but a pile of scattered blocks and end up with something completely my own. The feeling of creativity and bringing an idea into existence stayed with me as I grew older. This has planted a seed for what would later become my dream of pursuing computer science.

Alongside Legos, video games also sparked another part of my curiosity. I didn't just enjoy playing video games; I would be fascinated by how they worked, such as what kinds of things allowed the character to move or how the environment came alive. I wanted to look beyond the screen and understand the logic that made games so immersive and fun. Video games introduced me to the world of systems, design, and storytelling on a higher level, while Legos taught me the basic joys of building. Together, they laid a foundation for my decision to become a computer science major.

Computer science, to me, is a world that perfectly blends those two childhood passions into one. Like Legos, it allows me to construct something from the ground up, starting from nothing but lines of code. While for video games, it challenges me to think about creativity, problem-solving, and interaction skills. Choosing computer science is not just about pursuing a career; it is about chasing the same sense of wonder I felt as a child when I built my first Lego set or conquered my first video game. My dream is to take that wonder and turn it into a lifelong pursuit, building programs, systems, and maybe even games to help inspire the next generation to dream like I did once.

## The Future
In the future, I see computer science as more than just a degree. I think as a pathway to innovation. I want to use my skills to design programs, create applications, and  develop video games to spark the same curiosity I felt as a child to others. My goal is to build things that are both useful and enjoyable for users while combining creativity with technology.

In the future, I hope to work in a field where I can keep learning and experimenting with different programs. Just like how Legos and video games once inspired me, I want my work to inspire, whether it is through software, research, or teaching, I want to leave a mark that shows how imagination and technology can come together to shape the world.
