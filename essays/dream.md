## The Dream

From a young age, I was fascinated by the idea of building and creating things from Legos. As a child, my favorite pastime was to create some. Those colorful blocks were more than just toys to me; they were tools of imagination. With each piece I snapped together, I saw the power of construction and design come alive. I could start with nothing but a pile of scattered pieces and end with something completely my own. That feeling of creativity, of bringing an idea into existence, stayed with me as I grew older. It planted the seed for what would later become my dream of pursuing computer science.

Alongside Legos, video games shaped another part of my curiosity. I didn’t just enjoy playing them; I often found myself wondering how they worked. What kind of rules allowed the characters to move? How did the environments come alive with sound, light, and interactivity? I wanted to look beyond the screen and understand the logic that made games so immersive. Video games introduced me to the world of systems, design, and storytelling, while Legos had already taught me the joy of building. Together, they laid the foundation for my decision to become a computer science major.

Computer science, to me, is the perfect blend of those two childhood passions. Like Legos, it allows me to construct something from the ground up, starting with nothing but lines of code. Like video games, it challenges me to think about creativity, problem-solving, and interaction. Choosing computer science is not just about pursuing a career; it is about chasing the same sense of wonder I felt as a child when I built my first Lego castle or conquered my first video game. My dream is to take that wonder and turn it into a lifelong pursuit, building programs, systems, and maybe even games that inspire the next generation to dream as I once did.

## The Future
Looking ahead, I see computer science as more than just a degree—it is a pathway to innovation. I want to use my skills to design programs, create applications, and maybe even develop games that spark the same curiosity I felt as a child. My goal is to build things that are both useful and enjoyable, combining creativity with technology.

In the future, I hope to work in a field where I can keep learning, experimenting, and problem-solving. Just like Legos and video games once inspired me, I want my work to inspire others. Whether it is through software, research, or teaching, I want to leave a mark that shows how imagination and technology can come together to shape the world.
